This notebook used machine learning to predict [Iowa housing price] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview). Skills include EDA, feature engineering, imputing missing values, model selection and grid search for optimal parameters. The performance of the Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and RandomForestRegressor were compared. The test score for RandomForestRegressor is 0.17133, Ridge Regression is 0.11999, and Lasso Regression is 0.12097. Therefore, Ridge Regression performed best among the three algorithms tested.
